# little

...this is very much a work in progress

## Introduction

I am not really certain what my goals are with this project. At the moment it isn't much more than a wrapper around [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

## Credits

This makes use of [mo](https://github.com/tests-always-included/mo), mustache templates in pure bash. [Here is a link to mo's license](https://github.com/tests-always-included/mo/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

## Basic usage

```
(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
little, a static site generator

    help      displays this message!
    build     build your site!
    version   displays little version number

example: `$ ./little.sh help` would display this message

```
